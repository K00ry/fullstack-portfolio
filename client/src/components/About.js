                            <p>Iâ€™m a full stack Web Developer with a background in music. I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran and moved to NYC about a decade ago as a member of the internationally recognized band The YellowDogs.</p>
                            <p>I always had a strong/intense passion for technology, so after recognizing the links between tech and music, I decided to pursue a career in tech.</p>
                            <p>I started my journey by acquiring FEWD Tech Degree from Treehouse, followed by a few years of self-education while simultaneously developing various projects working for startups and businesses. I love learning new skills and sharing what I have learned because I believe the best way to master your skills is to share them with others.</p>
